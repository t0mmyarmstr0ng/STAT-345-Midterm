# STAT-345-Midterm
This is the UW-L STAT 345 Midterm Project for the fall 2025 semester. It involves HoopR package usage, data cleaning, graph making, and analysis for the changes in shot attempts for an NBA team over time. This one in particular looks at the Minnesota Timberwolves from the 2016-17 season to the 2024-25 season.
